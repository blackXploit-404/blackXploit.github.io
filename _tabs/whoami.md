# I'm 

Surajit — an average student a simple guy who loves technology more than anything. While most people spend their time outside, I’ve always felt at home sitting at my desk, hands on the keyboard and eyes on the screen, always eager to learn something new.

# let me tell you a story....

It all started back in 7th grade when I joined a basic computer tuition class. At that time, I only knew how to use MS Paint , Word , Excel etc — and I thought that was really cool! But soon, I realized that to truly learn tech, I had to explore it on my own. My curiosity became my biggest teacher.

I got my first computer around 8th or 9th grade. It came with Windows 10 pre-installed, and honestly, I had no idea how to use it properly. But instead of waiting for someone to teach me, I turned to the internet. I started watching YouTube videos, reading tutorials, and exploring everything from scratch — like how to set wallpaper, remove viruses , how to install software etc lol.

My YouTube and browser history was full of "how to" searches. That’s when my real journey began.

Slowly, I learned about programming languages, version control systems like Git and GitHub, and how to build projects on my own. 

Then came a turning point. I was in 11th grade when a video titled “How to Hack CCTV Cameras” popped up on my feed. Out of curiosity, I clicked on it. I didn’t understand much at first, but I found the topic incredibly interesting. That led me to discover the world of ethical hacking and cybersecurity.

I began watching tons of videos about Linux, IP addresses, networking, HTTP, browsers, phishing attacks, Dark Web , Tor and more. And honestly, I found it way more interesting than just development. I loved learning how systems work — and more importantly, how they can break.

At first, I did simple fun stuff — like creating fake phishing pages to prank my friends or running SMS bombers (just for pranks). Running Linux commands in front of them made me feel cool. But soon, I understood that real hacking isn’t just about looking cool — it’s about deep knowledge, thinking like an attacker, and solving complex problems.

So I kept digging deeper — learning about malware, Windows exploitation, gaining access to target machines, reverse shells, payload creation, explores Dark Web and more. That obsession grew as my friends started calling me a hacker — and that felt kind of awesome!

I’ve also watched many stories of young hackers who managed to breach big systems — like NASA, the NSA, or the CIA. These stories didn’t scare me — they inspired me. They showed me the power of knowledge, and that age doesn’t matter if your mind is sharp and your curiosity is endless.

Now, I’m focused on learning more about Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, bug bounty hunting, and exploring every corner of the cybersecurity world.

All this, I thank to the internet — from YouTube videos and tech forums to wikis and blogs. Everything I’ve learned so far has come from this amazing open world of knowledge.

And this is just the beginning...
To be continued.
